# **Credit Card Fraud Detection 🚀**  

## **📌 Project Overview**  
This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using **Machine Learning (ML)** techniques. The goal is to build a robust model that accurately classifies transactions as **fraudulent or legitimate** to minimize financial risks.  

## **📂 Dataset**  
- The dataset contains **credit card transactions**, with labels indicating fraud or non-fraud.  
- It includes features such as transaction amount, time, and anonymized numerical variables.  

## **🛠️ Tech Stack**  
- **Python** (pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)  
- **Machine Learning** (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, Neural Networks)  
- **Jupyter Notebook** / Google Colab  

## **🔍 Approach**  
1. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Handling missing values  
   - Feature scaling (StandardScaler, MinMaxScaler)  
   - Class imbalance handling using **SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique)**  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Distribution of fraudulent vs. non-fraudulent transactions  
   - Feature correlation analysis  

3. **Model Training & Evaluation**  
   - Tested various ML models: **Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, Neural Networks**  
   - Performance metrics: **Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, AUC-ROC**  

4. **Deployment (Optional)**  
   - Flask/FastAPI for API integration  
   - Streamlit dashboard for visualization  

## **⚡ Results**  
- Achieved **high recall and precision** on fraud detection  
- Improved fraud detection rate while minimizing false positives  

## **📌 How to Run the Project**  
1. **Clone the repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/credit-card-fraud-detection.git
   cd credit-card-fraud-detection
